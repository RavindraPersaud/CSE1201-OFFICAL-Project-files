temporary.txt

We use github to share code. Github does not allow for the sharing of blank folders.
This file is here to prevent folder that stores messages from being excluded in the Github code base.
Not having message_storage.dat in here ensures that no one's messages are accidentally transferred
when sharing/downloading the group-2-semester-project.zip file.

Therefore, if you are reading this, the data folder is made and this file "temporary.txt" is safe to delete if you 
wish.
